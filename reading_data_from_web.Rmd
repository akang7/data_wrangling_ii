## Scraping Table

First get the HTML

```{r}
url = "http://samhda.s3-us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/field-uploads/2k15StateFiles/NSDUHsaeShortTermCHG2015.htm"

drug_use_xml = read_html(url)
```

Get the tables from the HTML
```{r}
drug_use_xml %>%
  html_nodes(css = "table") %>% 
      # We have something that looks like piece of HTML code
      # We have things like table but we have 15 of them (we have tables 1 - 15)
      # But now we have too much stuff
  .[[1]] %>% # adding "list" - [[1]] give me first element (table)
      # we see "table 1, marijuana use in past year" - we have right thing
  html_table() %>%  # converting html code into table
      # View looks almost right
  slice(-1) %>% 
      # only case we use slice - bad function; slice lets us access rows of dataset by   
      # number
      # we don't want to filter rows by row # just in case we change and add data later
      # prefer to use filter
  as_tibble()
```
